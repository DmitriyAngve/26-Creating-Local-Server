# 26-Creating-Local-Server

In this small application I created a local json file, run local JSON server and also interact with various methods

This is simulating an endpoint on the server.

For testing this app ypu need to create a fake server.

There are have option for the user to post to the database adding to the json file from input field.

Unpretentious style included!
